      <h3>James: A Dungeons & Dragons one-shot</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's Note:</i> In what I am now (at least in my head) deeming "classic make-a-thon fashion," the media that these creators engage in really know no bounds. In two short days, James wrote a D&D one-shot about a retired ranger asking for help from a band of adventurers to save a dear friend, complete with homebrewed maps and encounters!

        At the time of writing I have not actually played this adventure yet (February... so soon...), but James has graciously exported the full PDF here for us to enjoy. As a preview, here's a segment from the opening setting...

      <h3>Turning a New Leaf</h3>
      <h4>When a retired ranger adventurer asks for a favor to save his companion, it is a race against time to save his dearest friend. (An adventure suitable for levels 1-5)</h4>

        Pushing past the sturdy oaken door to escape the stormy night, the party embraces the warmth of the tavern in a back alley of Neverwinter. Greeted by the aromas of the kitchen and the clattering of a house full of patrons, the party takes a seat and gestures for a round. The hearth glows warm to restore all guests fleeing the icy rains.

        Shortly after being served the party looks up to see a bard setting up on a stage lining the wall of the tavern, framed by a loft of visitors gesturing excitedly at the mysterious man. Moments later, the nameless bard begins to play a harp causing the room to settle as all eyes are drawn to the figure.

        His words, as he begins to sing, flow over the crowd like ambrosia and he sings a tale of a brave hero serving humanity and nature in all matters honorable and steadfast. He stood tall against the forces of evil, not alone, but with his faithful Shadow; a beast most deadly and cunning. The two grew in legend: the man of the forest cloak and the beast he rode into battle.

        Sweeping the story to a crescendo, the bard bellowed of the manâ€™s bravery in the face of death as he confronted a wyvern attacking a village with nothing but a broken arrow and his wits. Sustaining a crippling wound, the hero would retreat from his calling with his companion to Fermata of Arborea.

        Softening now, the bard spoke of the endless verdant trees and vale for the beast to traverse. As the bard breathed this image: a canopy of leaves, beams of sun and starlight drifting to warm faces below, a hallowed ground for heroes and fae, the party felt a cool rush of wind as they find themselves standing on soft grass in the glade of Arvandor; a realm far from the taverns warmth.
