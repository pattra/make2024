      <h3>Katryn: CSS animation</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's Note:</i> To me, Katryn is equal parts a creative and technological mastermind. I'm crazy lucky to know someone who is so singularly determined, smart, and creative; she really inspires me every day! Less rotting, more making!!
      </p>
      <p>
        For this make-a-thon, Katryn (<a href="https://github.com/katrynmc">@katrynmc</a>) created a neat CSS animation inspired by photosynthesis.
