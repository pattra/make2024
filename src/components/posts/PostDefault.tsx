      Welcome to our January 2024 make-a-thon zine!
    </p>
    <p>
      This year our creators had a weekend to put together a piece in a medium of their choosing that fit the theme. This year's theme was <b>turning a new leaf</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      The theme was intentionally abstract, to give people as much freedom as possible in interpreting it however they wanted to. Whether they took the theme to mean journaling, appreciating nature, or just learning new skills themselves -- we really covered the spectrum!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so impressed with the talent and creativity in both how people interpreted the theme and what they produced. I hope you enjoy browsing through everyone's work!
